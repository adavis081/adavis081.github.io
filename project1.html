				<h2 id="content">Project Overview</h2>
				<p><span class="image left"><img src="images\wine.jpg" alt="" /></span>This project is an exploratory
					analysis of a dataset containing reviews of thousands of wines. Wines span across various countries,
					regions, vineyards, and varietals. Lastly, every wine is given a score from 0-100. This project
					uses statistical analysis, natural language
					processing, and data visualization to explore the driving factors of a wine's score.</p>

				<h3>Results, Insights, and Lessons Learned</h3>

						<ol>
							<li><strong>Data Preparation:</strong><br> <br />
								Considering we want to investigate
								how certain factors impact rating, we want to ensure that possible 
								explanatory variables are clean. Some features are only missing a few values. With
								around 130,000 total observations, these can simply be dropped.<br> <br />
								However, price is missing a significant
								amount of data points. The distribution of price is heavily skewed as some
								wines are very expensive. These can be considered outliers and dropped to give
								price a normal distribution. We can then fill the missing values with the average price.
							</li>
							<br />
							<li><strong>Rating vs. Price:</strong><br> <br /> 
								We can use statistical analysis techniques to examine if
								the price of a wine has any impact on its rating. First, we check the correlation value
								between the two features. With a correlation of about 0.45, there are no
								immediate signs of a relationship. <br> <br />
								To examine further, we create groups of wines
								based on their price using quartiles. Our null hypothesis is that the average rating of these
								groups are the same, and our alternative is that they are different. After conducting an
								ANOVA test, our p-value tells us that we cannot reject our null hypothesis. It appears
								that price has no obvious impact on the ratings.</li>
							<br />
							<li><strong>Rating vs. Description:</strong><br> <br /> 
								Next, we will try to use natural language processing (NLP) to see what we can learn from
								the reviewer's descriptions as they relate to their scores. <br> <br />
								First, we clean the descriptions. To prepare the text for analysis, 
								we remove punctuation, special characters, and stop words that generate noise in
								the data. <br> <br />
								First, we conduct a sort of 'eye test' by generating wordclouds for different segments
								of ratings. Since ratings are normally distributed, we split them down the middle. We then
								generate a wordcloud for both of these groups. When examining these word clouds, there are no obvious
								results. We see a similar make-up words describing wine that were scored both poorly and well. They seem
								purely descriptive and do not contain sentiment. <br> <br />
								Lastly, we build an NLP classifier to see if we can bin wines based on their rating. We
								split wines by rating using the quartiles of the rating distribution. We label these
								wines 'fair', 'good', 'great', and 'excellent'. Our TF-IDF Random Forest classifier
								predicts with a accuracy of about 60%. This result probably has little meaning as this model
								does not predict any category very well. </li>
							<br />
							<li><strong>Thoughts and Lessons Learned:</strong><br> <br /> 
								Considering the results of this analysis, it does not appear that
								ratings can be explained by features in this dataset. There may be driving factors of these ratings, 
								such as the conditions each wine was made in, but that would require
								another dataset. It is important to note that these ratings are given by a large
								community of reviewers. All of these reviewers have their own thoughts and preferences,
								and therefore are biased. With wine reviews being a highly subjective process, it may be
								that these ratings cannot be explained or modeled through data.</li>
							<br />
							<li><strong>Next Steps:</strong><br> <br /> 
								If I were to continue this analysis, I would
								investigate the relationship between ratings and country of origin. However, there is a vast
								amount of countries and regions in this dataset. The wines reviewed 
								come from countries all over the world. However countries like Italy and France will have many more
								observations than countries like China. In the end, it may not yield significant results.
								<br> <br /> I am also interested in investigating additional datasets to explore other possible explanations of ratings.
